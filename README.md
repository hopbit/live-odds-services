Live Odds Services is a simple library providing Live Football World Cup Score Board functionality. 

It was created as a coding exercise for a Sportradar company recruitment process.

The Project is heavily inspired by [Apache Commons Lang](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang) project and solution
created by [Ihor Zaiets](https://github.com/Ihor-Zaiets/live_odds_services) project. 

The code is currently tested using JDK8.
Please ensure your build environment is up to date and kindly report any build issues.hih 

It is planned to support other JDK versions as well - 11, 17 and 21. More
information available [here](https://github.com/hopbit/live-odds-services/issues/11).

Building
--------

Building requires the following tools: 
* Java JDK
* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/download) 
  * _Look into section "Install" to find instructions for your specific environment_

The required Java version is found in the `pom.xml` as the `maven.compiler.source` property.

<!-- From a command shell, run `mvn` without arguments to invoke the default Maven goal to run all tests and checks.-->
From a command shell, run `mvn install` to invoke the Maven goal to run all tests, checks and build library in your 
local .M2_HOME repository. 

Contributing
------------

We accept Pull Requests via GitHub. There is no developer mailing list. If you'd like to contact us, 
then please use GitHub Issues since it is the main channel of communication for contributors. 
If you have a nice idea, then create an [enhancement](https://github.com/hopbit/live-odds-services/labels/enhancement) 
issue. If you find a bug, then please create a [bug issue](https://github.com/hopbit/live-odds-services/labels/bug).  

There are some guidelines that will make applying PRs easier for us:
+ No tabs! Please use spaces for indentation.
+ Respect the existing code style for each file.
+ Create minimal diffs.
  Disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. 
  If you feel the source code should be reformatted, create a separate PR for this change.
+ Provide JUnit tests for your changes and make sure your changes don't break any existing tests by running `mvn`.
+ Before creating a PR, run `mvn` (by itself), this runs the default goal, which contains all build checks.
+ To see the code coverage report, regardless of coverage failures, run `mvn clean site -Dcommons.jacoco.haltOnFailure=false`
